Introduction:
==========

This white paper seeks to put forth the economic and technical reasons that the digital tokens known as “App Coins” can develop a value in the market and maintain their value over the long term, should their associated application gain adoption by users. App Coins can be implemented for solid technical or economic reasons. However projects should think carefully about their particular application and evaluate if there are compelling technical or economic justifications for the creation of an App Coin or if a for-profit business model may be better suited than the or crowdfunding model involving a pre-sale of the tokens that gives access to the services.

Definition for App Coins:
App Coins are defined here as tokens that are native to Decentralized applications that have a digital token associated with their use or monetization. For a more general description of what a Decentralized Application is (outside of the economic and technical discussions below about the value of their digital tokens) see this white paper (https://github.com/DavidJohnstonCEO/DecentralizedApplications) and wiki entry.

When Does an App Coin Model Make Sense?

General statements:

###1) Centralization or the Requirement of Trust is Unacceptable.

An App Coin system is just a decentralized consensus mechanism, and one can always replace decentralized consensus with centralized consensus when designing applications (see "hybrid systems" below)

###2) They Implement Functionality That Bitcoin Can't Provide.

It is important to note that one should consider the capacities that Bitcoin can offer even though they may not be implemented yet. Therefore on should think of what the network "can't" offer rather than "doesn't" offer for the time being. There's enough development talent to have many open source applications written; assuming a more efficient competitor without the baggage of a coin won't pop up is foolish. There should be a solid technical or economic justification for why you're using a separate coin. Bitcoin was built for a very particular purpose and has a very specific social contract, and cannot deviate from that contract.

###3) The Transfer of Value Is Difficult to Negotiate Directly Between Two Untrusted Parties

When I want to pay for some Tor bandwidth I am willing to give up something of value, my coins, in exchange for a service rendered immediately. That transaction is self-contained and immediate.

On the other hand with a decentralized exchange the transfer of value may appear to happen between two parties, but because it's a public order the transfer really involves many parties, the whole market. For the order data to be honest a transaction must be completable by any
player in the market, so there needs to be global consensus about what has happened. If Bitcoin can't already support that consensus then you need an App Coin.

Permacoin is interesting in that it's ultimately a social contract: "You either censor all permacoin-stored data, or none at all" It fundamentally can't be negotiated between just two parties because the system aims to make choosing to censor a subset of the data not subject
to negotiation. Zerocash is similar, but with regard to the censor ability of Zerocash tokens.

###4) Has a Higher “Network Strength” from App Coin Ownership

Metcalfe's Law has demonstrated the power of a growing network effects. However strong network effects are not as simple as the player with the greater adoption will always prevail, as demonstrated by Venkatesh Shankar and Barry L. Bayus in their study on “NETWORK EFFECTS AND COMPETITION:
An Empirical Analysis of the Home Video Game Industry”, where they found “strong evidence that network effects are asymmetric between the competitors… Specifically, we find that the firm with a smaller customer network (Nintendo) has higher network strength than the firm with the larger customer base (Sega).” Where the term “Network Strength” is defined as (the marginal impact of a unit increase in network size on demand).

An example of this is the Apple OSX operating system which for a long time had a much smaller network size effect, however due to a higher network strength was able to overcome this and attain a much higher market share of operating systems in recent years. As shown in this graph of U.S. Apple Market Share over time.

“Particularly strong customer networks share a common, underlying (actual or perceived) bond along some important dimension (e.g., personal interests, demographic characteristics, fanatical product loyalty).”

Where this higher level of affinity for an application can be reinforced with ownership of an App Coin this effect can offer the App Coin an advantage over a system that uses Bitcoin for the same features.

Could be further breakdown to (a) increasing barrier of exit and hence increasing emotional ownership (b) boostrapping a network. The hardest part of any new network is always cold start problem, i.e. psychological resistance / inertia of adopting new things. AppCoin model leverages another human tendency , i.e. speculation and economic incentive, to overcome the inertia and reward risk taking.

###5) Freedom of Expression and Association Via an App Coin

During his key note speech at the Bitcoin Expo 2014 in Toronto titled “The Future Of Crypto-Currency” Andreas Antonopoulos makes the argument that App Coins will continue to multiply until everyone has such a token. He discussed thinking of currency as an application then thinking of currency as a means of expression.

This creates a situation where if a community wants to use a token to express a certain set of principles than that token will have a value to those that wish to identify or express those principles to others. This is evident in the different alternatives to Bitcoin that now exist.

####Example A. The Decentralization Community
Some users are highly concerned with the “centralization” that taking place in the mining market of bitcoin due to ASICs and as a response to that concern different communities have adopted Scripting algorithms for mining of coins that are more ASIC resistant and thus in their minds preserving of “decentralization”.

####Example B. The Proof of Stake Community 
For those users concerned with the use of large amounts of electricity in the mining process, the alternative use of “proof of stake” has emerged as a low energy alternative was to maintain consensus in a trustless ledger system.

####Example C. The Privacy Community
For those user concerned with anonymity and privacy of their transactions alternative systems have emerged with their own coins to serve this community. 

####Example D. The Charity / Tipping Community
For those that identify with a more light hearted and charity oriented view of currency, alternative systems that make tipping behavior and crowdfunding of fun initiatives have emerged to serve those users.       

SECTION TWO
==========
Comparison of App Coins to Bitcoin 

###1). Why There Is A Need For More Than Just Bitcoin

Some in their analysis of App Coins think anything can be done with Bitcoin, when in reality
only a very limited set of transaction types are possible in a fully decentralized way.

###2). Transaction Costs

Bitcoin reduces transaction costs for *specific* types of transactions. For instance it greatly reduced the cost of getting reimbursed for my expenses in the past few weeks - an employer was able to send funds from Israel to Canada in just a few minutes with total fees around
0.5% including the process of selling the bitcoins. Compare that to the multiple weeks I'll have to wait for my cheque from the BBC to clear, along with about 5% fees.

But Bitcoin in its current form simply cannot lower costs for other types of transactions. For instance sending money with provably strong anonymity isn't yet possible in a decentralized way - the (future attempts to do this using Bitcoin are under development) App Coin Zerocash can do that because the underlying technology supports
that type of transaction. Andrew Miller’s work on Permacoin (1) is an example in addition to the Maidsafe example.

That said this isn't always true. There are a lot of clever techniques out there for getting Bitcoin to do things previously thought impossible. (2)

###3). Network Effects/Forking the App Coin

“Infrastructure" is perhaps not the best argument for why forking App Coins is infeasible. Infrastructure in a decentralized environment, run by open source software, can be recreated instantly just the same way the software itself can. What can't be recreated is the social
consensus, and we've already agreed that network effects reduce transaction costs by providing for more liquid markets. Having said that social consensus can change. Markets can be convinced by allegations of fraud and unfairness, or simply higher costs; this is a big part of why I think Mastercoin and similar systems must be interoperable with each other, and only require use of the App Coins for valid, justifiable, technical reasons.

An interesting thing you can point out here is how with the Zerocash App Coin the number of users directly relates to the size of your anonymity set - use a less popular fork and you're not as anonymous.

There is however a big gotcha with these arguments: converting the App Coin to/from Bitcoin can be highly efficient. If users only need to hold a given coin briefly to do whatever the application requires the velocity of the App Coin will be high and potentially demand low. Like the transaction costs, whether or not this matters is a case-by-case thing.

SECTION THREE

Comparison of the Different Consensus Systems 

###1). Zero Knowledge Systems

The "dark horse" is “zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge” (zk-SNARK). If you haven't heard of the term, basically they let Alice prove to Bob that she ran some specified computer program on a set of data, some of which may be hidden from Bob. The proofs are small (hundreds of bytes) and can be verified in constant time in the range of milliseconds. Computing the proofs is reasonable as well. Critically the program a zk-SNARKs proves can also include functionality to verify another zk-SNARK recursively. While this hasn't yet been demonstrated "in production" it's quite conceivable that all App Coins can be replaced with a single zk-SNARK based system, kind of a hyper-optimized version of Ethereum. Such a system could be itself implemented as an Mastercoin-style embedded consensus system, resulting in "one App Coin to rule them all". Equally Bitcoin can add such functionality.

###2). Hybrid Systems

A more near-term competitor might be hybrid systems that have both centralized and decentralized aspects. Colored Coins is a good example: you can offer to sell Colored Coins for bitcoins atomically in a completely decentralized fashion (4) with honest pricing and market depth, but can't offer to buy Colored Coins for bitcoins because Bitcoin does not understand the Colored Coin protocol. However you can of course have a centralized exchange perform that task, and you can use a variety of techniques to keep that exchange honest. (similar to the techniques to keeping off-chain tx providers honest)

The regulatory uncertainty surrounding blockchain-issued assets will likely prove to be a major "transaction cost" in the form of counterparty risk. But with hybrid systems you can have a decentralized layer to fall back on if any given exchange fails, giving assurance to users that replacements will pop up sooner or later. Centralized systems push down transaction costs in other ways and can provide speeds that decentralized systems just can't, so the net effect may be that the simpler hybrid systems, without an app coin, have the advantage for many applications. FWIW I know of at least one player in the Colored Coins space that is looking at implementing exactly this model. Equally my own chaum token using fidelity bonded banks (5) concept is a hybrid system that potentially competes with Zerocash.

Conclusion
==========

Creating an App Coin first and foremost as a way to get paid there's a good chance you're creating something without an actual purpose. Given the current state of understanding in the community of the underlying concepts, calling them "fraudulent" is going too far, but all the same we don't need useless App Coins. Having said that, there are a whole host of cases where App Coins are essential for solid technical and economic reasons. When that is the case, using them to fund development efforts may be acceptable, although its worth projects thinking carefully if simply issuing shares for a for-profit business, or a simple crowdfunding effort, is more appropriate.
